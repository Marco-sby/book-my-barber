# 💈 Book My Barber — Hairdresser Appointment Web App

This project combines **academic business research** with a **working prototype** for a barbershop appointment platform.  
It began in the *Research Skills CA3* module, where I developed a complete **business plan** for a subscription-based men’s haircut scheduling service, and then built a modern, responsive prototype with **Node.js, Express, EJS, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

- Mission, vision, and values

## 📦 How to Run Locally

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/Marco-sby/book-my-barber.git
cd book-my-barber

# install & start
npm install
npm start
```

Then open **http://localhost:3000**.

> If you don’t have Node/Express set up, you can still preview the HTML by opening the rendered EJS in a compatible environment, but the recommended way is running via `app.js`.

---

## ☁️ Deployment

This app uses **EJS** (server-rendered), so GitHub Pages won’t render it.  
Use a Node-friendly host such as **Render**, **Railway**, **Fly.io**, or **Heroku**.  
Typical steps: connect your repo → set build command `npm install` → start command `npm start`.

## ✨ To-Do (Optional Enhancements)

- Add working form submission backend  
- Persist appointments to a database  
- Add animations/carousel  
- Include service pricing and gallery  
- Basic tests + CI badge
