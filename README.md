# 💇 Hairdresser Appointment Web App
This project combines **academic business research** with a **working prototype** for a barbershop appointment booking platform.
It started as part of the Research Skills CA3 module, where I developed a complete**business plan** for a subscription-based men’s haircut scheduling service.
The idea was then brought to life with a modern, responsive web app built with Node.js, EJS, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

📄 Business Plan

* The original business plan includes:

* Mission, vision, and values

* SWOT analysis

* 4 Ps of marketing

* Stakeholder and benchmarking analysis

* Hypothesis testing with survey data

* Financial projections and revenue model

* Franchise growth strategy
